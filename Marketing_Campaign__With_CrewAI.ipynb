Spaghetti cans (ready to eat): A convenient and affordable meal option that can be easily prepared for the customer and her family. Mascara: A small luxury that fits within the customer's moderate income level and aligns with her gender. To end this campaign successfully, we will need a promotional message advertising these products to the customer with the ultimate intent that they buy from us. This message should be around 3 paragraphs, so that it can be easily integrated into the full letter. For example: Tired of making dinner, get our best ready made canned tuna. Your lifestyle deserves a taste fo this fresh lobster. In the weekends, go on a day trip with the kids with these new lunch box containers.
